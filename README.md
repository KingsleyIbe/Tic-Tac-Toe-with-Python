# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-Python
Developing Games with python is fun, building Tic Tac Toe is more fun. This repository contains pseudo code for developing a simple  python Game using 'Tkinker'. I hope you catch fun with it.
Firstly, before we dive into understanding how the Game was built, just in case you are being curious visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe to learn more about the Game.
'Tic Tac Toe' is a logical Gaming thus it involves various steps: 

STEP 1: IMPORTING NECESSARY LIBRARIES:
Because we are using Python for this tutorial, we will need a python GUI library. In this Gaming building tutorial we be using the 'Tkinker' or 'Tk' library. 
Tk was developed as a GUI extension for the Tcl scripting language by John Ousterhout in 1991. In my opinion Tkinker is easier to learn, to use than other toolkits and it provides us with all widget needed for our Gaming building. You can research for other python GUI tools or you may want to learn more about Tkinker library https://www.python-course.eu/python_tkinter.php is a site to visit.
STEP 2: LAYOUT SETUP:
You don't want your interface to look bad, so I made a simple frame and populated with the necessary widgets. You can modify it if you don't like it.
STET 3: VARIABLE DECLARATION:
Here, we need to declear the variables we will be using.
STEP 4: METHOD DEFINITION:
Next, is to defined all the functions or methods we will be needing for our Game. You can give your function any name provided it is related to the task it performs.
In my code i decleared a function called 'scorekepper'. This function checks when a player clicks a button and compares the text value to either "X" or "O".
And with 'if' statement it determines a Win or draw for the Game. "You can try this with other conditional statements".
STEP 5: BUTTONS/LABEL SETUP:
The last step was to setup all the buttons and labels we used. 
in step we assigned a particular shape to each of them and other features.


NOTE: I used python 3.7.1 for this tutorial hence 'from tkinter import *'; if you are using python 2 or older version you will have to use 'from Tkinter import *'. Notice tkinker and Tkinker.
